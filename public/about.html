<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! It's great to meet you. I've been serving in the Army National Guard for over 10 years now, and I find it incredibly rewarding. Alongside that, I'm also pursuing my associates degree in computer programming at North Shore Community College. It's an exciting field to be a part of, and I'm eager to expand my knowledge in this area.</p> 
<p>Aside from my professional endeavors, I'm proud to say that I am a father to a wonderful 6-year-old. Being a parent brings me so much joy and fulfillment, and I strive to be the best role model I can be for my child.</p> 
<p>If there's anything specific you'd like to know or discuss, please feel free to let me know. I'm here to help!</p>
